# Gemini Context Review & Understanding

## 1. Project Overview & Goal
We are building a modern, data-driven website for **Cogesto Consulting** using the **Astro** framework. The primary objective is to create high-quality, compliant pages by repurposing structure and content strategies from top-tier consulting firms (like Wood Mackenzie or Bain), adapted specifically for Cogesto's brand and context.

## 2. The "Content-First" Workflow
I understand the process to be as follows:

1.  **Scrape & Extract:**
    *   Use the scraper scripts (e.g., in `content_factory/` or `webpage_to_markdown.py`) to extract content from target inspirational URLs.
    *   *Goal:* Get raw material to shape the narrative.
2.  **Contextualize:**
    *   Merge extracted content and adapt it for Cogesto Consulting.
    *   **Crucial Resource:** `cogesto_context.txt` (generated by `get_cogesto_context.py`) provides the ground truth for Cogesto's mission, values, and tone.
3.  **Structure Selection:**
    *   **Source of Truth:** Use files in `page_structure/**` (e.g., `bainservice_pagestructure.md`, `service1_pagestructure.md`) as the architectural blueprints.
    *   *Directive:* Do **not** use `Ref_html/**` for structure decisions; rely on the analyzed `page_structure` files.
4.  **Component Mapping:**
    *   Map the chosen structure to components listed in `COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md`.
    *   **Rule:** Prioritize "Fully Compliant" components. If a component is missing or non-compliant, create or refactor it following `COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`.
5.  **Implementation:**
    *   Centralize text content in `src/content/fr.ts` (or similar data files).
    *   Build the `.astro` page, importing content props and passing them to components.
    *   **Style:** Adhere strictly to `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `src/styles/styles.css` (Global CSS, BEM naming, no scoped styles).

## 3. Codebase Architecture Understanding
*   **Framework:** Astro + TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Global CSS (`src/styles/styles.css`). Components are style-agnostic (pure HTML structure + classes).
*   **Data Strategy:** Content is decoupled from presentation. Components receive data via `Astro.props`.
*   **Key Directories:**
    *   `src/components/`: Reusable UI blocks.
    *   `src/content/`: Data sources (`fr.ts`).
    *   `page_structure/`: Layout blueprints.
    *   `content_factory/`: Python scripts for migration/scraping.

## 4. Takes & Observations
1.  **Component Hygiene:** `COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md` indicates significant technical debt (many "High priority" refactors). As we build new pages, we should treat it as an opportunity to "fix-forward"—refactoring components like `HeroMultiTemplate` or `CardGrid` (if needed) to strict compliance before using them.
2.  **Context is King:** The `cogesto_context.txt` file is vital. To avoid generic "consulting speak," I will actively cross-reference generated copy against the specific services (e.g., "Business Linkage Program", "Elaboration de politiques") listed in Cogesto's context.
3.  **Page Structure Files:** These are excellent for standardization. They act as a bridge between the messy HTML of a reference site and our strict Astro architecture.

## 5. Questions for Clarification
1.  **About Page Structure:** You mentioned we are shifting focus to the "About" page. Is there a specific file in `page_structure/` that we should use as the blueprint for the About page (e.g., is `bainservice_pagestructure.md` close enough, or do we need to create `about_pagestructure.md` first)?
2.  **Target URLs:** Which specific "inspirational" URLs should I scrape to gather content/structure ideas for this About page?
3.  **Component Gaps:** If the chosen structure requires a component not yet in `COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md` (e.g., a specific "Timeline" or "Team Grid" component), should I create it from scratch immediately or try to adapt an existing `CardGrid`?

I am ready to proceed with the **About Page** (or any other priority) once the target structure and source URLs are defined.
