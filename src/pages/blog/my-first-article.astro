        <p>At the outset of the United Nations in 1945, US President Harry Truman acknowledged a global challenge ahead. “We all have to recognize – no matter how great our strength – that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.” Truman was referring to prioritising problem-solving for the good of the world over national interests. And making climate change a priority for all countries will remain a challenge at the latest iteration of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, <a href="/link/e1173c390f7c48b584ab4c894c122aad.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COP30</a>.</p>
        <p>Progress on lowering global carbon emissions is stubbornly slow. In our latest <a href="/link/9fe29b3a5e214ef497c95c2a81329a45.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Transition Outlook</a>, the world is on a 2.6 °C emissions pathway, with the 1.5 °C pathway increasingly out of reach. Energy security and affordability, rather than climate, have risen to the top of the agenda for many countries around the world. Meanwhile, gas-fired power investment, primarily in the US, is surging, driven by AI.</p>
        <p>New nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are due at COP30 lack the ambition to meet the Paris climate accord goals. Protestors who tested COP30’s security earlier this week illustrate the challenge of managing multiple stakeholders, each with specific priorities.</p>
        <p>With these issues on the table, COP30 has been billed as ‘the implementation COP’. This means it will develop existing climate policies, rather than announce a range of new goals. As COP30 faces the reality of changing the global energy sector, <a href="/link/6d2de9945b254630b92551524e562806.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five areas are worth watching</a>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Carbon markets</strong>. COP30 will refine carbon pricing, trading and nature-based offsets regulations to support investment in low-carbon supply or abatement solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>China’s pledges</strong>. China will likely outperform its latest climate pledge to expand wind and solar capacity sixfold by 2035. Rather than its NDC, watch how fast China expands its low-carbon supply chain.</li>
            <li><strong>US policy</strong>. With the US out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, state-level policies, load growth and corporate policies will be the primary drivers of low-carbon investment in America.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanding biofuels</strong>. The Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels, known as Belém 4x, intends to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels, including hydrogen and its derivatives, biogases, biofuels and synthetic fuels, by 2035.</li>
            <li><strong>CBAM compliance</strong>. As Europe begins to scale its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), developing countries will likely seek longer phase-in periods and industry carve-outs to comply with carbon taxes over time.</li>
        </ol>
