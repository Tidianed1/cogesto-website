# Development Workflow & Project Context

This document outlines the official, high-fidelity workflow for creating new pages for the Cogesto website. It also serves as a summary of the key contextual files that govern the project.

## 1. The Development Process: A Content-First, Quality-Driven Approach

Our process is designed to create comprehensive, effective, and high-quality marketing pages by putting content strategy and thoughtful design at the forefront. We build pages one at a time to ensure maximum focus and quality.

### Step 1: Deep Content Synthesis
Before any development, we perform a deep analysis of all source materials.
- **Scraped Content**: We analyze the `merged_..._content.json` files generated by our scraper to extract the core arguments, value propositions, key challenges, and solutions presented by inspirational websites.
- **Grounding with Cogesto's Voice**: All synthesized content is then meticulously grounded using `cogesto_context.txt` to ensure it speaks with Cogesto's unique voice, addresses the African market context, and reflects the company's actual expertise.

### Step 2: Propose a Custom Narrative & Structure
We do not use rigid templates. For each page, we design a unique narrative flow tailored to the specific service it describes.
- **Component Selection**: Based on the narrative, we select the **most suitable components** from the `@COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md`. The choice is justified by the content's nature (e.g., using `TabsTextMedia` for a step-by-step process, `BenefitsBlock` for key value propositions, `ServicesCarousel` for case studies).
- **Structure Proposal**: We present this custom page structure and component map for validation before any implementation.

### Step 2.5: Annotate State and Interactivity

When replicating HTML structures, it is critical to preserve attributes that control a component's state and behavior.

- **`data-*` Attributes**: Faithfully replicate all `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-io-type`, `data-target`). These are essential hooks for global JavaScript to manage component state, animations, and interactivity.
- **Stateful Classes**: Note and replicate any classes that indicate a state, such as `is-active`, `is-open`, or `js-wall-item`. The `js-` prefix is a strong indicator that an element is targeted by a script.
- **ARIA Roles**: Replicate all `aria-*` attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, etc.) to ensure the components are accessible and properly describe their state to assistive technologies.

Preserving these annotations is mandatory for the front-end interactivity to function correctly.

### Step 3: Await Explicit Approval
No files are written until the custom plan for the page has been reviewed and approved. This collaborative step ensures full alignment before execution.

### Step 4: Execute with Precision
Once the plan is approved, we build the final JSON file for the page with an extreme focus on detail.
- **Verify Component Props**: We read the source code of each Astro component (e.g., `HeroService.astro`, `TabsTextMedia.astro`) to use their **exact props**, preventing "empty" or "buggy" renderings.
- **Write Rich Content**: We write substantial, detailed content for every single property of every component. The goal is a minimum of 600 words of valuable content per page, telling a cohesive story.
- **Use Correct Assets**: All image and icon paths are verified and pointed to the correct, annotated files within `/public/assets/cogesto-asset/`.

## 2. Core Project Context

This project is governed by a set of key documents that serve as the single source of truth for strategy, design, and implementation.

- **`GEMINI.md` / Project Goal**: Outlines the primary objective of building a modern, data-driven website for Cogesto Consulting using the Astro framework.

- **`PAGE_CREATION_PROTOCOL.md`**: Defines the "Golden Path" for page creation, emphasizing a data-driven, component-strict strategy. It establishes the 8-section model as a foundational `strategie.json` blueprint for quality.

- **`COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`**: Contains the non-negotiable rules for creating or refactoring Astro components. Key principles include no scoped styles and reusable, data-driven props.

- **`COMPONENTS_INVENTORY.md`**: The master list of all available Astro components, their purpose, their props, and their current compliance status. This is the primary menu from which we select tools to build pages.

- **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**: The source of truth for all styling, including color palette, typography, spacing, and utility classes. It ensures visual consistency across the entire website.

- **`cogesto_context.txt`**: The ground truth for all content. It provides the specific business context, mission, values, and tone of voice for Cogesto Consulting, ensuring our pages are authentic.
